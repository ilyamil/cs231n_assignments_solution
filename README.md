# CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition - Solutions

Here you can see solutions for all assignments of CS231n offered by Stanford University in spring 2019. 
Check syllabus [here](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2019/syllabus)

If you want to run any of this assignment on your own machine, make sure you install all dependencies in 
requirements.txt for each assignment (better if you do it in virtual env). I also had some troubles with utils 
functions provided by authors, so I rewrite some parts of it.

Thanks to all instructors and assistants of CS231n. It was great!
